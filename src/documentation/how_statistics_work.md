## Unlikely notifications
When using Spartan you will observe certain notifications mention "unlikely (% data complete)". This is normal behavior, it means a specific detection of the anti-cheat is learning and won't take any action yet but is notifying you so you are aware of this.

## Data collection process
Spartan collects data per every detection of every check to measure probabilities and figure out who is using hack modules. As more data is collected, Spartan will enable preventions and then punishments for specific detections until eventually all detections are fully functional. This process may take minutes, hours or even weeks depending on how many players are online in your server at once and how active each player is when they are online. Fortunately, data stored is part of profiles stored in storage and memory, meaning players who help Spartan collect data do not need to be online all the time for their data to be used, as Spartan will use the stored data of offline players just fine.

## View the remaining data collection time
To learn about the "approximate" (Approximate because each check is a collection of detections and not one simple algorithm) state of Spartan's checks, run the command "/spartan menu", click the bottom item named "Management" and finally hover above the colored items of the menu to view the description of each item. If a check's preventions or punishments are not yet functional due to missing data, they will appear with a yellow warning in the end of the item's description, giving you a hint on what's happening.
