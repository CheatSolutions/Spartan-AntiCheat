## Below is a list of reasons you will see when checking a player using the “Player Info” inventory menu. To use this inventory menu, execute the command “/spartan info” to check yourself and “/spartan info playerName” to check someone else.

### Player has permission bypass:
When a player has the permission spartan.bypass they won’t be checked by any check. Additionally, when a player has the permission spartan.bypass.checkName they won’t be checked by the specified check. Click to learn more about permissions

### Detection is missing:
Some detections are not included in the jar file and require a different jar file to be implemented. For example, the Spartan AntiCheat requires the Spartan.jar to implement detections for Java players. Join our Discord server to learn more

### Custom:
Another plugin using Spartan’s Developer API or the anti-cheat itself has instructed a check to stop checking for a certain amount of time. This is likely to be introduced by a first-party or third-party compatibility to prevent instabilities and does not require fixing unless implemented improperly.
