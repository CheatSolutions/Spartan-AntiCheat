## CPU Requirements (Central Processing Unit)
#### Good single core performance needed, meaning GHz (clock count) matters more than core/processor count.
#### CPU is best to be released in the last 5 years, software improvement drives hardware improvement and viceversa.
## RAM for Spartan (Random Access Memory)
#### 384MB+, player data is constantly being analyzed and stored.
## Storage for Spartan
#### 2GB+ per month that the plugin is fully used.
## Server TPS (Ticks Per Second)
### 19+ out of 20 maximally possible in a server
## Player Latency
#### 0-300ms per player for best results (ms = milliseconds)
## Recommendation for Java's Garbage Collection
#### https://bit.ly/2VZfHKT (Aikar Flags)
#### https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags (Aikar Flags, if first URL does not work)
## Performance Disclaimer
#### Using SQL-based features will require additional system resources due to CPU threads being occupied by the wait time for the connection's reply, which allows for the realization of the query's success or failure.
